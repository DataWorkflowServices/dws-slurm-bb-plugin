# PRs from forked repos will not have the permissions to invoke check runs
# (i.e. publish test reports) or publish code coverage summary comments.
# Instead, the "Publish Integration Test" and "Publish Unit Test" workflows
# on the main branch will be activated using the "workflow_run" trigger. These
# workflows will publish the test reports and code coverage summary comment on
# behalf of the pull request run.
#
# NOTE: This workflow is designed to run on PRs from forked repositories and is
# not guarenteed to run perfectly in PRs from branches in the same repository.
# In particular, test reports from check runs will be written to the wrong
# workflow summary, since both the "Build" and "Pull Request" workflows will
# run in the same repository.
